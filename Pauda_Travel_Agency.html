        <h2> Personal Reviews: </h2>
        <blockquote> "While in the house keys keep going missing and they don’t show up again.  It’s weird, but I never feel alone in this building.”</blockquote>  
        
        <blockquote> "As I was going past the Sultan's Palace I saw a fair-haired mansitting in the window, but after I looked for about a few seconds he suddenly disappeared out of thin air." </blockquote>
        <blockquote>  I went to the Sultan's Palce at night and heard shrieking and screaming. I also heard the sounds of body prts hitting the floor during the night. There was also this strange tinkling music and the scent of incense throughout the house." </blockquote>
